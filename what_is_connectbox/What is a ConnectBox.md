ConnectBox are self-contained, self-powered, WiFi based portable media distribution system. It allows users to create a full featured ‘digital library’ from which media (text, video, audio, applications) can be shared on mobile phones, tablets, laptops, desktops in an off-the-grid environment without depending on access to the internet or electricity. Any device with WiFi capability can wirelessly connect to a ConnectBox and access/download content with a simple web browser. ConnectBox will support over 16+ simultaneous 360p video streams/download sessions from different devices.

## **<span style="color:gray">Where would a ConnectBox be used?</span>**

A ConnectBox acts as a local digital access point that isn’t capable of being restricted in traditional ways; allowing information to penetrate areas that would otherwise be unreachable. From educational, book study, language learning, audio programs, video content, text materials and applications can be delivered regardless of local internet connectivity or regional/national censorship. If you can provide power occasionally, a ConnectBox can provide the digital resources for learners. While internet access in many communities is unreliable or unaffordable, you can deliver important educational, healthcare and community resources without requiring users to incurring additional costs; they connect with the devices they already have.

## **<span style="color:gray">What is it made of?</span>**

A ConnectBox uses off-the-shelf commercial hardware, a custom PCB, custom printed case, a micro-SD flash drive, and software that when combined give you a small, low-powered webserver. The webserver acts as a captive portal, and delivers files that are stored on the flash drive or USB flash drives. It is based on freely available open source software that was developed by a number of different individuals and/or teams of people. It is available with build, connection, configuration and customization instructions for creating and customizing your very own ConnectBox. It runs a small Linux operating system on the hardware that can be tuned with added features and functions.
