The following document explains how to build the firmware for a ConnectBox.
This can be done on a Windows machine with VirtualBox or on a Mac or on a Raspberry Pi 3+ or 4

After making the firmware, you need the hardware configured.  There are two basic styles:

Hardware made with the NEO Pi from FriendlyArm with a customized PCB and case that accommodates a 6200maH battery and has a built in RTL8812au WiFi chip or you can build your design using the NEO Pi and another WiFi chip without any battery.

Secondly you can build the firmware for a Raspberry Pi model.   This includes the Zero through the model 4.  When using the Raspberry Pi, there is limit of about 7 users on the native WiFi but external WiFi modules can be added to increase the capability of connections.  This limit is due to the hardware used.  Additionally, with the Raspberry Pi you can use the internal WiFi for a station connection to an access point while using an external WiFi module for AP mode connections to users.

Contact help@connectbox.org if you have other questions regarding the software or hardware.
